ESP32 based SMPTE/EBU timecode generator, with NTP slaving, for Leitch and similar studio/broadcast clocks.

So we have a few  Leitch Illuminated 12 Inch SMPTE Timecode Analog Broadcast Studio Clocks and its more
modern digital, 19" rack sized variant. The each take a typical studio time signal; a SMPTE/EBU style
'audio' signal (4V p.p., baud, 80 bits, 2400Hz/4800hz FM modulated sequences of 80 bits).

These are then connected to some ESP32's that pick up the time from the office its NTP
serves; and provide these to the clocks.

= Hardware

On the back of all clocks is a typical red/black two wire spring terminal. This is internally wired to
a 2x6 IDC connector; pin 1 and 2. It turns out that pin 3 and 4 contain a nice 5V voltage. All in all
these 4 wires are used to wire up the ESP32 (Wemos) boards.

The units seem to not always pick up a 3v3 Peak to Peak voltage generated by the GPIO. So we've added
a small BC546 transistor (base tied to the GPIO through a 2k2 registor, E to ground, C with a 1k pullup)
to raise the signal a bit.
